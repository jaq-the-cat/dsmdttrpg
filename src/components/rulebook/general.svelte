  <summary> General Rules and Explanations </summary>
  <h2>Checks</h2>
  <p>
    Skill Checks are how most things are decided. You roll a d20 (a 20 sided
    die) and add the relevant modifier against the action's difficulty (decided
    by DM, a static value, or against an enemy's stats) and if you pass, you can
    do the action. Checks such as Explosives and Mechanics require 2 rolls, one
    after the other, and you must pass both to succeed in that action. If a
    2-roll skill is instead used for damage, pick one of the stats to roll for,
    and only roll once.
  </p>
  <h2>Proficiency and Expertise</h2>
  <p>
    With Proficiency, you get a +2 bonus to the relevant roll. With Expertise,
    the bonus is +3.
  </p>
  <h2>Advantage</h2>
  <p>
    With Advantage, you can roll twice and pick the higher value. It is gained
    by attacking a Stunned, Bootlooped or Unaware enemy.
  </p>
  <h2>Critical Hits</h2>
  <p>
    A Critical Hit is an attack that deals double damage. It happens when the
    player rolls a Nat 20 on their hit check or when they attack from Stealth.
  </p>
  <h2>Stealth and Noise</h2>
  <p>Stealth is an important aspect of this game.</p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Attacks coming from hiding deal a Critical Hit and cannot be blocked or
    dodged. If it is the first round of turns in combat, and you begin hidden,
    you automatically get the first turn. If you then also get a higher
    Initiative roll than your opponent, you get to have a second turn before the
    enemy can retaliate, but this time out of Stealth. This stacks with multiple
    hidden members of a party, with you being able to take 4 turns (2 from
    Stealth, 2 from higher Initiative) with 2 members before the enemy gets
    their own.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    While unseen, walking makes Loud Noise up to 2m away, and running up to 4m.
    Walking while Crouching does not make any noise.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Loud Noises roll a 1d4 + DM-given modifiers dependant on what type of noise
    it is, with baselines below. The resulting roll is also the range in meters
    the noise can be heard from.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    Enemies within 4m can hear any Loud Noise no matter what. The enemy's
    Passive Perception is used to determine if they hear it. If they are
    actively searching for someone, instead use an Investigation roll.
  </p>
  <br />
  <ul>
    <li>Gunshot: +10 + 1d4</li>
    <li>Pistol Shot: +8 + 1d4</li>
    <li>Screaming: +4 + 1d6</li>
    <li>Striking Metal: +4 + 1d4</li>
    <li>Talking: +2</li>
    <li>Silenced Gunshot: +2</li>
    <li>Striking Plastic: +2</li>
    <li>Whispering: +1</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Rate</h2>
  <p>
    Rate in a Weapon description means how many times it can hit per turn, with
    the user having to roll hit and/or damage for each hit. Every subsequent hit
    deals half of the original damage.
  </p>
  <h2>Melee Weapons</h2>
  <p>
    Melee weapons only need to do a hit check, using the Strength or Dexterity
    Stat + Melee, if the attack is being blocked or dodged, but they have to do
    a damage check in return.
  </p>
  <h2>Ranged Weapons</h2>
  <p>
    Ranged Weapons must first hit, then they can deal damage. The difficulty is
    based on the target's Passive Dodge. Capacity means how many times the gun
    can be shot until having to be reloaded or replaced with a different Arm
    Weapon.
  </p>
  <h2>Death</h2>
  <h3>Drones</h3>
  <p>
    Reaching 0 HP by taking exterior damage (not Hunger) and while not under the
    influence of the Solver puts you in a Dead state. You can come back if your
    core is carefully extracted and put in a new body by a Drone with
    Proficiency or Expertise in Mechanics.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extraction process requires a Work Hammer, Screwdriver and Bone Saw and
    the insertion process requires a Work Hammer, Screwdriver, Bone Saw,
    Industrial-Grade Glue and 2x Screws.
  </p>
  <p>
    An extracted core can be kept alive by being fed 1x Fresh or Used Oil
    (depending on which they need) every 30 minutes of real-life time. Failing
    to do so kills that Drone permanently.
  </p>
  <h3>Humans</h3>
  <p>
    Reaching 0 HP by taking exterior damage (not Hunger) puts you in a Downed
    state. You can roll for recovery up to 3 times per Downed state. A different
    player can also try to help you using their Medicine bonus. Difficulty is 10
    + your Vitality modifier. If successful, revive at 1 HP.
  </p>
  <h2>Weight</h2>
  <p>Carrying Capacity is determined by your Species and Strength.</p>
  <p>Base Capacity at 0 Strength is 5kg.</p>
  <h2>Resting</h2>
  <p>
    Resting is basically sleeping, healing and decreasing Oil or Blood. It is
    interrupted when a member suffers damage.
  </p>
  <h3>Short Rest</h3>
  <p>
    A Short Rest lasts 2 in-Universe hours, running 1 auto-successful Regenerate
    abilities on Drones that have access to it and healing Humans and Avian
    Drones for 25% Max HP.
  </p>
  <h3>Long Rest</h3>
  <p>
    A Long Rest lasts 8 in-Universe hours, healing all party members to Max HP.
  </p>
  <h2>Hunger Damage</h2>
  <p>
    Max HP / 10 is the baseline for Hunger damage. It cannot be lower than 1. If
    the value is fractional, such as 1.5 or 2.8, truncate down to 1 and 2,
    respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you start suffering Hunger damage while Out of Combat, the ticking damage
    instead happens once every real-life minute or 10m travelled.
  </p>
  <h2>Out of Combat</h2>
  <p>
    Out of Combat you can do anything you like, with no limits on movement
    besides difficult terrain which may require an Athletics or Flying check.
    Actions such as picking something up or opening a door can be done freely,
    but other things such as investigating an area, picking up something heavy
    or trying to convince an NPC to do/say something may require Skill check at
    the DM's discretion.
  </p>
  <h2>Stun/Bootloop</h2>
  <p>
    If an enemy is Stunned/Bootlooped, they cannot move or do any action for 3
    turns. A Stun can be recovered early if you suffer non-Hunger damage, a
    Bootloop cannot. If the Stun/Bootloop happens outside of combat, it lasts 15
    real-life minutes. Attacking a stunned enemy gives you Advantage.
  </p>
  <h2>Fall Damage</h2>
  <p>
    All species can take Fall Damage at a rate of 1 damage per meter above their
    Jump Speed that they fall.
  </p>
  <p>A fall from 3m deals a Human 1 Damage, because their Jump Height is 2m.</p>
  <h2>Damage Types</h2>
  <p>There are 5 types of damage: Strike, Pierce, Slash, Energy and Hunger.</p>
  <p>
    Being Vulnerable to a damage type means your HP takes the damage value +1 in
    damage.
  </p>
  <p>Being Resistant is the same, but you take -1 (minimum of 1).</p>
