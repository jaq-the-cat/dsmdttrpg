  Describe your character's appearance and backstory in as much detail as you'd
  like, including how they got to the Campaign's setting (given to you by the DM
  prior to its start).

<p>
  Only Disassembly Drones can have Yellow visor color at the start of the game.

<p>
  You should also describe your character's personality and Alignment, going
  from Lawful Good to True Neutral to Chaotic Evil. Humans and Workers who start
  the game as Chaotic Evil are automatically Insane.
