<p>Enemies only have 2 actions, and always end their turn with 2 reactions.</p>
<p>
  If the enemy is an unarmed Human/Worker Drone, they do not get any actions
  besides moving/dashing. If in Melee range and you have any weapon equipped,
  roll a 1d20 Brutality roll and describe how you kill them. A Nat 1 fails to
  kill.
