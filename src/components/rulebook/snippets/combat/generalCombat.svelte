<p>
  When Combat begins, every member rolls an Initiative roll, which determines
  the order at which turns are taken (higher being earlier).
</p>
<p>
  During your turn, you have 4 Actions, which can be an attack, movement, dash,
  weapon swap, attempt to hide, etc. You can attempt any action in any order.
  You get an extra Reaction if you don't attack during your turn, up to 5.
</p>
<p>
  Remaining actions can be used in between turns as Reactions. If you Attack 3
  times and end your turn, you have 1 Reaction remaining. If you dash, move,
  swap weapons, and attack, you don't have any reactions.
</p>
<p>
  A Reaction can be dodging, blocking, or an Attack of Opportunity, which you
  can do when an enemy tries to run away from you from melee distance.
