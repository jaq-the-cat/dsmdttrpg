<h2>Rate</h2>
<p>
  Rate in a Weapon description means how many times it can hit per turn, with
  the user having to roll hit and/or damage for each hit. Every subsequent hit
  deals half of the original damage.
</p>
<h2>Melee Weapons</h2>
<p>
  Melee weapons only need to do a hit check, using the Strength or Dexterity
  Stat + Melee, if the attack is being blocked or dodged, but they have to do a
  damage check in return.
</p>
<h2>Ranged Weapons</h2>
<p>
  Ranged Weapons must first hit, then they can deal damage. The difficulty is
  based on the target's Passive Dodge. Capacity means how many times the gun can
  be shot until having to be reloaded or replaced with a different Arm Weapon.
