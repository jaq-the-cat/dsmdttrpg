<h3>Drones</h3>

  Reaching 0 HP by taking exterior damage (not Hunger) and while not under the
  influence of the Solver puts you in a Dead state. You can come back if your
  core is carefully extracted and put in a new body by a Drone with Proficiency
  or Expertise in Mechanics.
</p>
<p>
  The extraction process requires a Work Hammer, Screwdriver and Bone Saw and
  the insertion process requires a Work Hammer, Screwdriver, Bone Saw,
  Industrial-Grade Glue and 2x Screws.
</p>
<p>
  An extracted core can be kept alive by being fed 1x Fresh or Used Oil
  (depending on which they need) every 30 minutes of real-life time. Failing to
  do so kills that Drone permanently.
