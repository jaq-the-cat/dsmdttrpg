<p>
  Winged Drones made by JCJenson as long-distance messengers and light-load
  carriers when radio and internet are unavailable or otherwise unable to be
  used. They are about as tall as Disassembly Drones with retractable feathered
  wings coming from their arms. Although usually pacifists, Avian Drones are far
  from defenseless, being equipped with claws on their hands and dangerous
  talons on their feet, and will attack if threatened or provoked.
