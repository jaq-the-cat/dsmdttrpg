<h2>Blood</h2>
<p>
  Humans have a Blood reserve of 10. They spend 1 Blood during a Short Rest and
  2 Blood during a Long Rest. Their source is fresh water and human food. A
  slice of Bread or cup of Water replenishes 2 Blood. Due to the variety of
  Human foods, the DM can choose how much Blood other kinds replenish, but these
  are the baselines.
</p>
<p>
  Blood can be used to Heal at a rate of 1 Blood to 2 HP. You cannot attack in
  the same turn you use to Heal using Blood.
</p>
<p>It can be replenished by eating or drinking.</p>
<p>
  At 0 Blood, take Max HP / 10 damage per turn until death or replenishment.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever they take damage, they roll a 1d(Total Damage). They lose that amount
  in Blood.
