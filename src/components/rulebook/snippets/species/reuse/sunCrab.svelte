<h2>Core Crab</h2>
<p>
  Solver Drons Drones can have their cores removed by a Pierce attack aimed at
  the chest that deals more than 25% of their Max HP in damage, which turns them
  into a Core Crab. They have 2 HP and +0 in every check except Acrobatics, in
  which they have a +6. While in Core form, they can attempt to get back inside
  their bodies if they're within melee range by running an Acrobatics check
  against their body's VitalityVerticalf the original body dies, the Core is
  forcefully removed and cannot get back into the body until it is repaired.
