<h2>Abilities</h2>
<h3>Eat (Insane)</h3>
<p>
  Can be used on a dead body (Human or Drone) to drain their entire Fresh Oil
  reserve at once. Eating someone during combat takes 2 turns to complete.
</p>
<h2>Drone Repair</h2>
<p>
  When there are no healing items available, Worker Drones can be repaired using
  parts, a tool such as screwdriver or wrench, and a bonding agent.
</p>
<p>Worker Drones can be repaired with Worker or Disassembly Drone parts.</p>
<p>The difficulty is the missing HP of the player to be healed.</p>
<p>
  The healing amount is generally dependant on the specific parts used, but
  there are some static:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intact Drone Parts heal for 1d8 + Mechanics HP.</li>
  <li>Damaged Drone Parts heal for 1d4 + Mechanics HP.</li>
  <li>Replacing a damaged limb heals for 1/4 + Mechanics Max HP.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Disassembly Drone Part Scavenging [NC]</h2>
<p>
  Worker Drones can choose to replace their own limbs with scavenged Disassembly
  Drone limbs.
</p>
<p>The roll difficulty is 10 + your missing HP.</p>
<p>
  Succeeding in limb replacement triggers a Solver Infection roll of 1d(10 -
  Limbs Replaced).
</p>
<p>
  DD Arms grant them a hand and one singular weapon, the last one used by the
  Disassembly Drone before the limb was removed.
</p>
<p>Switching weapons when using a DD arm requires 1 Fresh or Used Oil.</p>
<p>
  DD Legs, when they are both replaced, increase running speed to regular
  Disassembly Drone levels and jump height to 6 meters.
</p>
<h2>Solver Infection [NC]</h2>
<p>
  If a Worker Drone uses Eat on a Solver-infected Drone body, or a
  Solver-enabled Drone uses Bite on a Worker Drone, the DM rolls a hidden 1d10.
  A value of 1 turns the Worker into a Solver Drone.
</p>
<p>This should be kept secret from the player.</p>
<p>
  Drones that have been infected in the previous or current game sessions have
  their Oil loss and Heat gain doubled by all sources and cannot infect Worker
  Drones using Bite.
